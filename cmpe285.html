<p><strong>Prereq</strong>:</p>
<p> <em>CMPE 220 or CMPE 202 or Instructor consent. Students who do not provide documentation of having satisfied the class prerequisite and co-requisite requirements (if any) by the second class meeting will be dropped from the class.</em></p>
<p><strong>New Prereq check procedure</strong></p>
<p>We will adopt a new procedure (akin to that used by some of the other engineering departments):<br>At the beginning of the term, have all the students in the class provide a copy of their transcripts, with the prerequisite class grade highlighted. The instructor will then check off against the roster, and drop any and all students who do not provide such proof of having completed the prerequisite with a satisfactory grade.<br>For classes with co-requisite requirements (such as CMPE 110), the student will provide the transcript (proving that the class has already been passed) or a printout from MySJSU (proving that the student is currently enrolled). Add the following to the class greensheet: ”Students who do not provide documentation of having satisfied the class prerequisite and co-requisite requirements (if any) by the second class meeting will be dropped from the class.</p>

<p>Apart from big term project(s) and presentation, there are homework assignments, 
  a mid-term exam and a final exam. Some exams might be take-home. The weightings 
  for grading are: Term Project(s) 40%, Homework 20%, Midterm 10%, Final Exam 
  10%, and Team Presentation / Lecture assignments 20%. Schedule and course materials subject to change with fair notice. Success in this course is based on the expectation that students will spend, for each unit of credit, a minimum of forty-five hours over the length of the course (normally 3 hours per unit per week with 1 of the hours used for lecture) for instruction or preparation/studying or course related           activities including but not limited to  internships, labs, clinical practica. Other course structures will have equivalent workload expectations as described in the syllabus. </p>

  material. </p>

<h2>University Policies</h2>
<h3><em>Academic Integrity</em></h3>
<p>Your own commitment to learning, as evidenced by your enrollment at San José State University, and the University’s Academic Integrity Policy requires you to be honest in all your academic course work. Faculty members are required to report all infractions to the Office of Student Conduct and Ethical Development. The policy on academic integrity can be found at <a href="http://sa.sjsu.edu/student_conduct">http://sa.sjsu.edu/student_conduct</a>.<br>Instances of academic dishonesty will not be tolerated. Cheating on exams or plagiarism (presenting the work of another as your own, or the use of another person’s ideas without giving proper credit) will result in a failing grade and sanctions by the University. For this class, all assignments are to be completed by the individual student unless otherwise specified. If you would like to include your assignment or any material you have submitted, or plan to submit for another class, please note that SJSU’s Academic Policy S07-2 requires approval of instructors.</p>
<h3><em>Campus Policy in Compliance with the American Disabilities Act</em></h3>
<p>If you need course adaptations or accommodations because of a disability, or if you need to make special arrangements in case the building must be evacuated, please make an appointment with me as soon as possible, or see me during office hours. Presidential Directive 97-03 requires that students with disabilities requesting accommodations must register with the <a href="http://www.drc.sjsu.edu/">Disability Resource Center</a> (DRC) at http://www.drc.sjsu.edu/ to establish a record of their disability.</p>

<h3>Term Project <a name="writingproject" id="writingproject"></a></h3>
<span class="blacktext"> </span>
<p><strong>Title</strong></p>
<p>Mobile Application: Compute My Grade</p>
<p><strong>Admin</strong></p>
<p>Form a group of 3 or 4 people to complete this mini project. </p>
<p><b>Description</b></p>
<p>Based on the knowledge you gain from lab exercieses  in class, this project gives you more hands-on development opportunity in a team environment. Minimum requirements for the project is as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The coding of the project should be based on the sample project compute2a (as in the lab exercise) </li>
  <li>The main page of the app needs to allow the entering of points for the the following items:
    <ul>
      <li>Homeworks </li>
      <li>Labs </li>
      <li>Project</li>
      <li>Presentation </li>
      <li>Midterm </li>
      <li>Final </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The grade setting page needs to allow configuration of the maximum points for each items. E.g.
    <ul>
      <li>Homeworks - 500</li>
      <li>Labs - 500</li>
      <li>Project - 200</li>
      <li>Presentation - 100</li>
      <li>Midterm - 100</li>
      <li>Final - 100</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The grade setting page needs to also allow configuration of each items' scaling factors. E.g. 
    <ul>
      <li>Homeworks - 10% </li>
      <li>Labs - 40%</li>
      <li>Project - 20% </li>
      <li>Presentation - 10% </li>
      <li>Midterm - 10%</li>
      <li>Final - 10%</li>
      <li>(The ratio must be added to 100%) </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The grade settings page needs to allow configuration of grade from A to F. E.g. 
    <ul>
      <li>90% to 100% is A</li>
      <li>80% to 89% is B</li>
      <li>70% to 79% is C</li>
      <li>60% to 69% is D</li>
      <li>Below 59% is F</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>A checking mechanism must be in place to ensure all the ranges of the grade are not overlap and a percent number in the range of 0 to 100 is assigned one and only one grade. </li>
  <li>The main page of the app needs to display the following: 
    <ul>
      <li>A sample student info includes last name, first name, email, phone number and ID. The information must be served remotely from one of the member's web site. </li>
      <li>A sample course description. You can use the 235 greensheet as an example. The course descripiton must be served remotely from one of the member's web site (that is different than where the student info is served). </li>
      <li>The area allowing points to be entered for each item mentioned above</li>
      <li>The computed final grade of the student </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Extra Credits</strong></p>
<p>Extra features can be implemented in the project for extra credits. Here are some of the ideas: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Fancy sliders for configurations </li>
  <li>Login / authentication process </li>
  <li>Support for multiple classes </li>
  <li>Backend programming support for save and restore </li>
  <li>Fancy overall UI</li>
  <li>(Each group can come up with its own ideas of extra credit). </li>
</ul>




<h3>Grade <a name="grade" id="grade"></a></h3>
<p>Check grade at my.sjsu. Grade will be not be given via email.</p>

<h3>General Policy <a name="generalpolicy" id="generalpolicy"></a></h3>
<p>The university and departmental policies and deadlines for course drop will 
  be applied. Makeup exams cannot be offered, except under exceptional conditions, 
  such as documented serious illness/accident, etc., and only at the professor's 
  discretion. </p>
<p>Each student is responsible for his/her individual assignment, and must not 
  copy anyone else's work. Students who borrow solutions from others will find 
  themselves unable to pass the course. The minimum penalty for every student 
  involved in the duplication of individual assignments or exams will be receiving 
  a zero score on the submitted work. </p>
<p>For group project, all the work has to be done by your OWN group. Do not try 
  to download "free code" from the Internet and hand in as a project. WE WILL 
  FIND OUT. Do not share your work with others. So DO YOUR OWN WORK and EARN your 
  grade.x</p>
